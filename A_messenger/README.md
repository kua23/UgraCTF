Challenge Question
`— Next!

The iron door creaked open, letting the noise of the queue into the cubicle for a second, only to slam shut again with a metallic rumble.

— Pap…

I stammered. He was standing in front of me, wearing a hood with his nose just barely visible, and an emblem on his forehead that seemed to glow in the dim light of the lamp. That emblem looked familiar to me.

Faster than I could think of anything, he handed me a strange piece of paper with the same emblem on it, and sprang out of the door like a scalded man.

On the paper, there was a cipher.`

## Solution
-First, try to find the symbols on the given .png image. It shows a 'sun' like symbol.
-Using [https://images.google.com/](Google Images), figure out that the symbol is from the game 'Papers, Please' and is the symbol of the Order of the Ezic Star. Hence, the 'Pap...' in the Challenge question too
-[https://papersplease.fandom.com/wiki/EZIC](Papers, Please)
-To find the cipher, google the Ezic Decoder, which gives another picture that must be placed over the original picture containing text to decode.
-To solve it, the picture used to decode must first be aligned with the rectangle dots on the top and then, with the bottom.
